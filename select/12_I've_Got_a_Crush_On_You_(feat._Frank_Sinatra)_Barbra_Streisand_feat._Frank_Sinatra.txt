I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

I wonder...
Could you, coo, now?
Could you care?
For a cozy cottage that we could share
The world will pardon my mush
Cause I have got a crush
My baby, on you

I've got a crush on you
(I've got a crush on you)
Sweetie pie
(Sweetie pie)
All the day and night-time
(All the day and night-time)
Hear me sigh
(Hear me sigh)
I never had the least notion
(The least notion)
That I could fall with
(I'd fall with)
So much
(So much emotion)
So much emotion

Could you coo?
(I could coo)
Could you possibly care?
(I could care)
For a lovely cottage
(Ooo that cottage)
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
Yes, I have got a crush
My Barbra, on you
You will make me blush, Francis!
(Yes) I have got a crush
My baby, on you.
