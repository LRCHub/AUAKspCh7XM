[00:06.16] Hmm, I've got a crush on someone
[00:17.17] Guess who?
[00:22.17] 
[00:21.79] I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
[00:30.08] All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
[00:36.12] I never had the least notion
[00:40.43] That I could fall with so much emotion
[00:59.43] 
[00:48.78] Could you coo, could you care?
[00:54.08] For a cunning cottage we could share
[00:59.90] The world will pardon my mush
[01:05.10] 'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
[01:25.10] 
[01:17.06] How glad a million ladies
[01:19.33] From millionares to caddies
[01:22.36] Would be to capture me
[01:28.02] But you had such persistence
[01:30.55] You wore down my resistance
[01:33.15] I fell, and it was swell
[01:45.15] 
[01:38.88] You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
[01:44.17] How I won you, I shall never, never know
[01:51.26] It's not that you're attractive
[01:53.57] But oh, my heart grew active
[01:56.36] When you came into view
[02:07.86] 
[02:03.02] I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
[02:11.61] All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
[02:18.15] I never had the least notion
[02:23.54] That I could fall with so much emotion
[02:42.54] 
[02:30.99] Could you coo, could you care?
[02:38.46] For a cunning cottage we could share
[02:44.79] The world will pardon my mush
[02:51.02] 'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
